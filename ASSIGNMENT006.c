Write a program where the hosts 1 accepts a string of two numbers 
sent by host 2 and host 1 replies with the sum of two number. 




Write a program to show working of a echo server.



The problem is to implement a client - server user-level application using sockets API in C. 
The Server application has to support at least five clients simultaneously. Server accepts strings 
from clients (strings until EOF is provided i.e persistent connection) and replies with reverse strings. For example, 
when client sends “IITHYD”, Server replies with “DYHTII”. Both server and client(s) have to output both 
sending & receiving strings on the terminal.
