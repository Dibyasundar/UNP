Write a program where the hosts 1 accepts a string of two numbers 
sent by host 2 and host 1 replies with the sum of two number. 

  
  
  
The problem is to implement a client - server user-level application using sockets API in C. 
The Server application has to support at least five clients simultaneously. Server accepts strings 
from clients (even multiple strings from each client) and replies with reverse strings. For example, 
when client sends “IITHYD”, Server replies with “DYHTII”. Both server and client(s) have to output both 
sending & receiving strings on the terminal.
